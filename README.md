1. Create and read a file. The format of the file is to output the number (n) of each line. In addition, the number output number (m) of each line is to be in the form of n (mode 4). Take n and print the entire file. Complete the output and the entire line output.

2. While studying mathematics, I found the following results and decided to calculate them. However, since it should be calculated according to the input value, I decided to write it as a program. Implement the answer below. 2, -4,6, -8,10, -12,14 ..... n where n = (-1) (k + 1) ∙ 2k, k = 1,2,3 ...... is up to m. Take m to find the sum of the cumulative totals.
Ex) If the input is 5, 2 + (-4) +6 + (-8) +10 = 6. Reducing time complexity has advantages. Think of time complexity as a series of steps to answer the program.

3. I want to draw a rotating equilateral triangle in a circle. For input, enter the diameter of the circle, and draw an equilateral triangle (where each vertex must be above the line of the win), and then draw an equilateral triangle with additional rotation (just one more round).
Ex) If you rotate 30 degrees, you have to draw 12 times for 1 turn, 45 degrees rotate 8 times, and 90 degrees 4 times.)

4. The trainee who wants to study hard wants to write a program that records how much he studies every day. Enter the time shown in the figure below and the [study] column to record the total study time in [Total Study], and enter the time for the [Play] column to accumulate the total break in [Total Play]. Calculate time cumulatively. Finally, press [Cal] button to calculate [Total Study] and [Total Play]. If the total study time is much, “You Win” is displayed. Do it. (You can output any character before pressing [cla].)
Ex)

# test5.py

5. A traffic accident statistics program will be prepared. In big titles cars are sedans and trucks. In the case of sedans, sedan 1 (s1), sedan 2 (s2), and sedan 3 (s3) are made of three cars, and in the case of trucks, trucks 1 (t1) to trucks 7 (t7) exist. We want to record the occurrence of an accident for an individual car (considering only a 1: 1 car accident) and find the total number of car accidents and the number of car accidents for each individual car. Print out the answers to each question.
Ex) First, input the car crash and output the result.
s1 

t1

result : s1:1, t1:1, sedan’s crash:1, truck’s crash:1, car’s crash:2

s1

t2

result : s1:2, t2:1, sedan’s crash:2, truck’s crash:2, car’s crash:4
